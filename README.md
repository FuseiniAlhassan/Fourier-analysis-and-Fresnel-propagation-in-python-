# Fourier-analysis-and-Fresnel-propagation-in-python-
Digital Holography: Fourier Analysis and Fresnel Propagation in Python

This project explores the reconstruction of digital holograms using Fourier optics principles and Fresnel diffraction simulation. Starting from real .tif hologram images, the notebook performs:

âœ… Square padding and grayscale conversion

âœ… 2D Fourier Transform and frequency domain visualization

âœ… Frequency filtering via customizable masks

âœ… Inverse Fourier reconstruction of complex fields

âœ… Fresnel propagation using scalar diffraction theory

âœ… Normalized TIFF export of intensity maps


The code is modular and annotated for educational and research reuse, and it serves as a computational optics tool for analyzing interference patterns, simulating diffraction, and comparing holographic quality.

ðŸ“Œ Use cases:
Digital holography, physics/optics education, phase retrieval, beam propagation simulation, and research prototyping in Fourier imaging.

ðŸ“‚ Output: reconstructed_output.tif
